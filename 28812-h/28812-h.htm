<p>This is the second of a series of books
on &#8220;How to Live,&#8221; by Dr. George F.
Butler. These books range from childhood
to old age. The boy and the
girl, the young man and young woman,
the young husband and young wife,
middle-aged people, and old people are
instructed in these books in matters
of the utmost importance to their health
and happiness. The first in this series
was &#8220;Every Boy&#8217;s Book.&#8221; These two
books are especially intended for boys
and girls from ten to fourteen years of
age, but every father and mother should
read them, so they, too, can know
the truth about these great sex facts,
and be prepared to answer children&#8217;s
questions&mdash;now sometimes troublesome.</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<p>The greatest duty of mankind lies
in the proper uprearing of our children.
The fact is recognized, but is the duty
fulfilled? Do we rear our children as
we should? There is but one answer:
We fail. Teaching them many things
for their good, we yet keep from them
ignorantly, foolishly, with a hesitancy
and neglect unpardonable&mdash;knowledge,
the possession of which is essential for
their future welfare.</p>
<p>The first necessity for well-being is
a healthy mind in a healthy body. We
can give our children that, if we will,
by teaching them all about the body,
its source of life, its different functions,
and its care. The child should grow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_ii' name='page_ii'></a>ii</span>
to maturity knowing that the human
body is something fine, something that
accomplishes good, something to be proud
of in every way. Above all should the
child be taught all concerning the process
of reproduction, just as it is taught the
action of the stomach or of the brain.
By so doing, we can produce a better
and healthier and happier generation to
follow ours. By what strange and mistaken
impulse in the past such absolutely
required teaching has been so studiously
withheld is beyond all comprehension.</p>
<p>We want the best for our children.
We want them to grow up with right
thoughts and habits, yet we keep from
them the knowledge without which their
thoughts and habits will surely be imperiled
when there arises in them the
generative instinct, which has its effect
upon both male and female youth alike.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_iii' name='page_iii'></a>iii</span></p>
<p>We give them no information as to
sexual matters; and, when it comes to
them, it is too often but in the way of
half-truths, mysterious, exciting to the
imagination, and dangerous.</p>
<p>Yet how simple and natural the giving
of this information might be made;
and how easily the child might be safeguarded!
Mankind has demands which
must be gratified. We have hunger;
we have thirst; we have the impulse of
reproduction. Each is right and natural.
There should be no difference in the
consideration of either of these wants.
All about them the child should be
taught, from the beginning, so that all
will be natural and right and commonplace
and a matter of course long before
the age is reached when the sexual
instinct is developed.</p>
<p>Is not this reason? Is it not healthful,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_iv' name='page_iv'></a>iv</span>
logical, common sense? Is it not the
wholesome and right and proper view?</p>
<p>Nature is devoted to reproduction.
From the cell to the flower, and so on
upward, the creatures of the world are
but renewing themselves, and the learning
of this is the greatest and most
beautiful of all studies. All this the
child can be taught.</p>
<p>Elementary biology, or the study of
subjects of what we call zoology and
botany combined, can be made the
most attractive of studies to any child
who has learned to read. The boy
or girl may be taught that the trees
and flowers are living things that are
beautiful and are male and female. The
child may be shown how the bees carry
the pollen from flower to flower, and
how other plants and flowers are produced
in that way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_v' name='page_v'></a>v</span></p>
<p>He can be taught the wonder of seed,
and its consequences. He can be shown
the birds in their mating, and the marvel
of the egg, and why it can produce a
chicken. And thus the child, boy or girl,
may be led on, through the gradations, to
a study of the human body, and how
reproduction is provided for there as
in the bodies of all other living things,
vegetable or animal.</p>
<p>Before the child, boy or girl, has reached
the age of ten, long before the sex
instinct has been aroused, the sexual lesson
will have been learned innocently and
thoroughly and, when the change comes,
it will be as no bewildering, exciting thing,
but something anticipated, and received
with a sense of understanding and
responsibility.</p>
<p>This knowledge almost unknowingly
acquired as a child, will mean health
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_vi' name='page_vi'></a>vi</span>
of mind and of body, and the avoidance
of what may result most evilly.</p>
<p>How is sexual instruction given now?
In tens of thousands of instances&mdash;no
doubt in the majority&mdash;not at all. Lectures
to youth of either sex are given
sometimes, but only when they have
reached what is called &#8220;the age of understanding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is where parents err, and seriously.
The teaching has been deferred too long.
The young of either sex, long before
puberty, have acquired some knowledge
of the mystery&mdash;which should have been
no mystery at all&mdash;and late teaching,
however sound and wise, but gives an
added and inviting direction to the
subject suddenly made to assume a
new and startling importance. It arouses
curiosity, and more. It may sometimes
be harmful.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_vii' name='page_vii'></a>vii</span></p>
<p>As for the youth never taught at all,
those who acquire their knowledge only
through accidental sources&mdash;usually incapable,
and too often vicious&mdash;their
case could not be worse. They are unprepared
for one of the tests and demands
for life. Their parents are guilty.</p>
<p>There is nothing impure in nature.
To guard the children, to prepare them
for every phase of life, is the parents&#8217;
duty. The child is pure, and to the
child all things are pure. Teach the
child, simply as a matter of course, all
about the ways of reproduction, and
to the boy or girl purity will remain
when the age of sexual sway and impulse
comes. This is the only law in the case.
Let it be followed, and the generation
to follow will be clearer, wiser, and
healthier than is the present one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_viii' name='page_viii'></a>viii</span></p>
<p>It is my hope that this &#8220;Every Girl&#8217;s
Book&#8221; (with &#8220;Every Boy&#8217;s Book&#8221; which
preceded it) will afford the means so
long needed and desired for teaching
children what they should be taught.
I have tried to tell the story of sex
naturally, in a clear and simple way,
from the development of life, and
of life&#8217;s relations, from protoplasm all
through organic life up to mankind.
Its teachings should result in wide
promotion of the innocence of knowledge
which is better, infinitely, than
the imperiling innocence of ignorance.</p>

<h2>I</h2>
<h3>HOW THE STORY BEGAN</h3>
</div>
<p>Her name was Elsie and she was
asleep in a cozy nook in the woods,
which was the beginning of it all.</p>
<p>Many strange things may happen to
a little girl who falls asleep in the woods,
but there never happened to any other
little girl, either asleep or awake, in the
woods or at home, a more important
thing than that which had its start for
Elsie while she lay there under the
green boughs beside a bubbling spring
of crystal-clear water, the scent of pines
and flowers sweetening the still air. A
robin redbreast whistled melodiously for
&#8220;rain, rain, rain,&#8221; and the cows in the
pasture, who do not like rain as well as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
they do sunshine, lifted up their voices
in protest, calling &#8220;oo-oo-ohh! moo-oo-hh!
noo-oo-hh!&#8221; as if they were trying to say
&#8220;no, no, no!&#8221; and could not speak the
English language well. It was a peaceful
woodland scene, a scene into which, if
you were awake, you would expect that a
railroad train would be about the last
thing that could possibly enter.</p>
<p>But Elsie was asleep, and in her
dreams she was sure she saw a great
locomotive engine charging down upon
her with frightful speed. As soon as she
saw it she tried to cry out, but could not
do so. Somehow she could not send a
single sound from her lips. Then she
tried to jump out of the way, but was
unable to do that either. She could not
even move in the slightest degree. So,
full of terror, she thought she stood there,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
helplessly, while the engine rushed nearer
and nearer, puffing forth vast clouds of
black smoke, and roaring and hissing
and clanking. Again she tried to scream,
and could not: again she tried to run
aside, but could not move. She seemed
so small, so tiny and weak, beside that
monster! And she wondered how it
could possibly bear to hurt her, a big,
powerful thing like that&mdash;it was not fair!
But&mdash;bang! The cowcatcher caught her
up&mdash;</p>
<p>And she awoke to see a fuzzy bumble-bee
just alighting on her nose!</p>
<p>Though Elsie did not, as a general
thing, care much for bumble-bees, and
would rather have their room than their
company, she was so highly relieved to
find that the gigantic engine was <i>only</i> a
bumble-bee that she said, &#8220;Oh!&#8221; with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
such violence of surprise and gladness
that the bee, doubtless as much afraid
of her as she had been of the dream-engine,
shot out of sight in an instant
and she never saw him afterward, that
she knew of.</p>
<p>She sat a moment staring after him,
trying to collect herself, for she was
confused with her sudden awakening,
and then she jumped up laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a funny bumble-bee!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;<i>I</i> wouldn&#8217;t have hurt him!&#8221;
Then in conscious dignity, proud to
think that she was now big enough for
something to be afraid of, she took up the
pail of water that she had come to get
from the spring and hurried homeward.</p>
<p>Now if this were all the story it would
not amount to much, and it never would
have got itself told in these pages. And,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
if Elsie had been like some girls, who are
not chums with their mothers, the story
would never have been told here either,
because she would not have repeated the
adventure to her mamma, in which case
her mamma would not have taken the
story up where the daughter left it, and
shown its importance. But Elsie and
her mother were like two sisters, a big
and a little one, and there were not many
things that happened to the one that
the other did not hear of very soon.
So away went Elsie singing and laughing
and swinging her pail of water, her
bright hair blowing in wisps around her
sweet face with its red lips and cheeks
and white teeth, the prettiest, loveliest
picture in the whole lovely landscape of
foliage and flowers and pastures and
meadows.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>Nobody in the world ever yet found a
prettier picture anywhere than a fresh
and clean girl is, as everybody will admit
if asked, and Elsie was fresh and clean
even if she had just been rudely aroused
from sleep. She bathed her whole body
twice every day, washed her face and
hands often, brushed her teeth always
after eating, smiled a great deal, and
got plenty of fresh air and sunshine,
and this was enough to make any girl
fresh and clean and pretty, or almost
enough.</p>
<p>Of course a girl must eat sufficient
food, and must brush her hair and take
care of her nails, and all those little
things&mdash;everybody knows that. But the
main things, beside food, the things, too,
that some little girls fail in, are air, sunshine,
water and smiles. Elsie had all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
these and therefore she looked clean and
fresh and pretty.</p>
<p>She had on a dress too, naturally, but
I don&#8217;t know just what kind of a one it
was, for that is a small matter compared
with the body itself. I think it was some
kind of a calico, made for vacation
frolicing, for Elsie was a city girl staying
in the country for the summer, and almost
anything was good enough for that.</p>
<p>So Elsie, fresh and clean, dancing and
singing up the lane, swinging her pail of
crystal water, the loveliest sight in the
whole lovely landscape, came in view of
the house where they were staying.
And no sooner had she caught a glimpse
of her mother on the porch than, eager
to tell her funny experience, she ran
forward in pleasant excitement, crying
out:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mamma! Such a queer thing&mdash;Oh,
Oh, it was an engine, the biggest,
biggest you ever saw&mdash;and&mdash;and it
stepped on my nose&mdash;I mean it was only
a bumble-bee and&mdash;it&mdash;it almost ran
right over me&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t my little girl somewhat mixed
in her speech!&#8221; smiled her mother as
Elsie paused for breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I guess I&mdash;I am!&#8221; Elsie faltered.
&#8220;But then, I&#8217;m so excited!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you are excited,&#8221; smiled her
mother, putting her arm around her
shoulders and walking with her to the
kitchen. &#8220;And when you are calm you
may tell me all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Elsie carried the pail of water to
the sink and set it on its shelf. And when
she had worked off her surplus energy
in this way she felt sober enough to tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
her story clearly, and she did so, snuggled
in her mother&#8217;s arms in the hammock on
the porch. She finished by saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that a funny thing, mamma,
that I should dream that the bumble-bee
was an engine just going to run over me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the really important part of the
story began. Her mother answered:</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
<a name='II_WHAT_THE_BEE_WANTED_OF_ELSIES_NOSE' id='II_WHAT_THE_BEE_WANTED_OF_ELSIES_NOSE'></a>
<h2>II</h2>
<h3>WHAT THE BEE WANTED OF ELSIE&#8217;S NOSE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it may seem funny, but it is
natural. When you were asleep
you heard the bee buzzing and rumbling,
and the sound reminded you of an
engine, so you began to picture an engine
in your mind, and with the queer mixture
of fact and fancy that are common to
dreams you thought it was coming right
at you. And it was only a bumble-bee
taking a look at your little red-and-white
nose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsie clapped her hands and laughed.
Then she asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;What did the bee want to see my
nose for, mamma?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He thought, perhaps, that it was some
new kind of a bud, and he wished to
examine it,&#8221; Mrs. Edson smiled. &#8220;A
little girl&#8217;s face is very much like a pretty
flower. Your hair was tumbled all about
your head, I suppose, and your little
rosebud of a nose, peeking through,
attracted the bee.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this idea Elsie laughed again,
joyously.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, mamma,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;why
should the bee wish to see my nose,
even if he did think it might be a flower?
Do bees eat flowers, mamma?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsie&#8217;s mother threw her a sudden
look that was almost a startled one.
Then she hugged her close and kissed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a great big little girl you are
getting to be, darling!&#8221; she said, gazing
fondly at her. This did not seem to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
Elsie much like an answer to her question,
and she fixed her eyes brightly on
her mother&#8217;s face as if waiting for her to
go on with her words. But her mother
only said: &#8220;I scarcely realized that you
were no longer my little baby-girl, and
that you were instead almost a young
lady, old enough to understand many
new things, among them the reason why
a bee goes to flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused again, looking at her big
little girl wistfully. She was thinking:
&#8220;Elsie has begun to be a woman now,
and I shall soon, all too soon, lose my
baby-girl, for she will grow up and marry
and go away to a home of her own and
have a little girl like herself, just as I have
had her!&#8221;</p>
<p>This made her feel sad, but she said
nothing to Elsie of this feeling, for she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
would not be able to understand it and
it would only make her feel sad too.
By and by she would tell her what it
meant to have a husband and children
and home of her own, after her parents
were passed away, and she must begin
to prepare her for this knowledge now.
So, finally, she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, darling, bees do not eat flowers,
though they eat a part of them, or a product
of them. The most important thing
that they visit flowers for, as far as the
world is concerned, is to fertilize them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fer-fer-ilize!&#8221; stammered Elsie.
&#8220;What is that, mamma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not ferferilize, darling, but fertilize,
fer-til-ize, which means to make rich,
or fruitful. As strange as it may seem
the bees and other insects are of vast
importance to men&mdash;sh-h!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>She suddenly held up her hand, motioning
for silence, and Elsie, wondering what
was coming, followed her mother&#8217;s pointing
finger with her eyes. What she saw
was a bee hovering over a bright yellow
buttercup that grew almost within reach
of where she sat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch him!&#8221; whispered her mother.</p>
<p>Elsie did so, holding her breath for
fear of scaring him away. He alighted
on the flower, crawled clumsily over it
for a second or two, pausing now and
then to bury his head in the blossom,
but he did not do anything else, that
Elsie could see, except to tumble about
very awkwardly and funnily and then
fly away to another buttercup and repeat
the operation. Elsie drew a long
breath and looked at her mother inquiringly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It did not seem as if he did much, did
it, dearie!&#8221; she said in answer to the
look. &#8220;But in reality he did a great deal,
for he&mdash;what shall I say&mdash;married? Yes,
married! The bee actually married those
two buttercups together, so that next
season, when these two flowers, the papa
and mamma, are dead and gone, there
will spring up and grow other buttercups,
baby-plants, the children of these two.
If it were not for the bee, or other insects,
we should have no bright flowers in the
world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Elsie&#8217;s eyes opened wide. She
thought a moment, then, &#8220;Could he
marry my nose to anything?&#8221; she burst
forth. But seeing the absurdity of the
notion before the words were fairly out
of her mouth she joined in her mother&#8217;s
laughter over it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, dearie, of course not. It is only
flowers that bees marry together. And
not the least strange thing about it is
that they do not know they are doing so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know what they are doing!&#8221;
exclaimed Elsie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, they know what they are
doing for themselves, but they can&#8217;t
have the least notion of what they are
doing for the flowers and indeed for the
whole world! Without plants there
could be no life of any kind on earth. It
is the plants that produce life. Through
them come animals, and even men and
women and little girls. The plants feed
on the earth and air, which men and
animals cannot do. A man or a lamb
cannot eat the soil or live on air, but a
plant lives by eating the minerals and
gases and water of the earth and air, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
the man and the lamb eat the plants,
and so are able to live. Without the
plants we could not exist, and without
the insects, which fertilize the plants,
so that they can grow, the plants themselves
would soon die. Don&#8217;t you think
now that what the bee did was quite an
important matter, even if it did seem so
trivial?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-yes,&#8221; Elsie hesitated. She did
not yet grasp the full depth of her
mother&#8217;s words. They meant so much!
&#8220;But,&#8221; she continued, her bright eyes
eagerly turned on her mother&#8217;s face, &#8220;we
don&#8217;t eat the buttercup, mamma, do we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sweetie, but we do eat very gladly
a part of it, and that is the part that the
bee visited the flower for, and which he
took away as his fee for marrying the
two. Can you guess what it is?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>The idea of a bee performing a marriage
between flowers and taking a fee for it
was a little too much for Elsie, and when
it was added that she and her mother
ate this fee such a look of amazement
came into her sweet face that her mother
could not help smiling broadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the honey, little girlie,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;The bee takes the honey from
the flower and carries it home to the hive,
where he stores it up until he has a great
mass of it, and then the bee-man gets it
and sells it to the grocer, who sells it to
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W-e-l-l!&#8221; said Elsie slowly, &#8220;if that
isn&#8217;t strange!&#8221; She sat a moment
thinking of this miracle, her mother
watching her lovingly and considering
what she ought to say next, for she had a
great secret to tell her little daughter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
a secret so great and important that
much wise thought was required to study
out just how to make it plain to a girl
as young as Elsie. Besides, she was
interested to know what Elsie herself
would say next, for she was bringing her
up to think logically, so that she might
know always how to ask the right question
at the right time, instead of the
wrong one. And she was very much
pleased when Elsie, instead of putting
the last question first, as some little girls
would have done, put the right one first
by saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;But, mamma, how <i>can</i> flowers marry!
And how can a bee possibly marry
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the right question to ask first,
even if it was a kind of double-headed
one, because this marriage was the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
of the wonders that had amazed her, and
the answer to it would lead logically to
the fee and the honey eaten by people,
and these questions would be easier to
make plain after the first one was
answered.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>THE HUSBANDS AND WIVES OF PLANTS</h3>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Edson drew a long breath
because she knew the time had
arrived when, for her little daughter&#8217;s
sake, she must give her the information
which would mark her growth from girlhood
into young womanhood, and the
fact disturbed her, for she did not want
to lose her little girl, even in exchange
for the lovely young lady whom she
knew would take that dear little girl&#8217;s
place. But it must be done, and, thankful
that she had studied the subject
enough to know how to do it in a nice
and plain way, she began:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, dear,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;you must know that the flowers are
the husbands and wives of plants, made
so by nature. They are in their way as
truly married as Mr. and Mrs. Jones are
in their way, or as your papa and I are.
This marriage is a law of nature, invented
to carry on the race, whatever that race
may be, whether it is that of mankind,
or plants, or animals, or birds, or even
fishes. For not only do men and flowers
marry, everything in nature does the
same&mdash;turtles, frogs, robins, elephants,
everything!&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsie wished very much at this point
to ask if her mother had ever seen an
elephant&#8217;s wife, thinking that she must
look rather funny, much different, to
say the least, from a flower&#8217;s wife, but
as the answer came to her at once,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
without asking the question, she said
nothing. Of course an elephant&#8217;s wife
must be another elephant, as the flower&#8217;s
wife was another flower. But it was all
very singular, and the sparkle of her eyes
as she looked into her mother&#8217;s face
showed her interest in what might be
coming. Mrs. Edson went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;We will begin with plants, because
they came first into the world as living
beings, and all other living beings not
only had their origin in plants but live
by aid of them to this day. From the
plants grew animals, and from animals
grew men and women and little girls.
It took a long, long time for all this to
come about, so long that the human mind
fails to grasp or comprehend it; and at
first, when one hears of it for the first
time, it seems wholly impossible and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
unbelievable. But science has proved
it to be true, and even shows the exact
way in which the various changes were
made. Many, if not all, the steps by
which we mounted from the condition
of a tiny speck of jelly-plant, a speck no
bigger than the point of a pin, to become
human beings are still in existence and
are frequently observed by scientists.
With a microscope anybody may see
them. So we know that the theory of
evolution, as it is called, is a true one.
It is also an exceedingly wonderful and
beautiful truth, full of secrets and surprises
of the most interesting and delightful
kind, as I shall show. Now let&#8217;s
go and examine the buttercup that the
bee just married to the second buttercup.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsie jumped up with a little gurgle of
joy and ran ahead of her mother to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
flower. This was better than playing
&#8220;secret&#8221; with Rosie and Eva and the
other girls, for their secrets were not real
ones, they were just made up and they
did not amount to very much after all,
but this was a real one, kept up in earnest
with the bees and flowers. And now
she was to be let into it! Mrs. Edson
bent over the bright yellow blossom,
taking it gently in her fingers to prevent
it from nodding so briskly in the breeze
that they should be unable to examine it
closely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, dear,&#8221; she said, pointing
with a twig to the different parts as she
named them, &#8220;right here, in the exact
center of the blossom, is a bunch of green
growing in the form of an oval, shaped
somewhat like an egg with the smaller
end upward.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, oh, yes!&#8221; Elsie answered eagerly.
&#8220;What is it, mamma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Broadly speaking we will call it the
ovary. I am not going to confuse you
by giving you too many hard words at
first, words like corolla, carpel, style,
stigma, and the like. I shall name only
two parts of the flower for you to remember
just now, because only two are really
necessary to be named at this point.
So the name of this one is&mdash;what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ovary!&#8221; answered Elsie quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ovary! It is called so because
it contains ovules, which are tiny seeds
or eggs. That is the mother part of the
plant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The mother!&#8221; Elsie queried. &#8220;Why,
mamma, is there a father too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dearie, many plants have both
a mother and a father part, which grow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
near together in the same flower, while
other plants have only a father part, and
still others have only a mother part.
This buttercup has both, has both the
male and the female principle. The
ovary is the female, and here, above it
and surrounding it, you see a number of
taller spires, yellow in color and each of
them bearing a tiny enlargement, a kind
of knob, at the top.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, but that&mdash;that can&#8217;t be the
papa part! Is it, mamma?&#8221; she cried,
examining the rather insignificant appearing
spires dubiously. &#8220;They don&#8217;t look
much like a&mdash;a papa!&#8221; she said in some
disappointment. Her mother laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They certainly do not look much like
a man-papa,&#8221; she returned, &#8220;but they
form the papa part of the plant, nevertheless,
and are truly the papas of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
baby buttercups. And their name is the
second one that I wish you to remember
from now on. It is stamen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stamen!&#8221; said Elsie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, each of these stems is called a
stamen, and they form the male part of
the plant, the father part. Many plants,
those of the simpler kinds, have only one
stamen and it grows in the flower so that
its head hangs right above the ovary.
Here you see that all of the stamens are
above the ovary, and the reason why
they are placed there by nature you
will see very soon. What I wish now is
to show you why the bee came to the
flower.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know&mdash;it was for honey! Isn&#8217;t
that what you said before, mamma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, darling, but do you see any
honey here?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, mamma, and I never knew before
that buttercups had honey. I always
thought honey came from a beehive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does come to us from a beehive,
but it comes from flowers first, and one
of the many kinds that furnish it is this
buttercup. The bee sips it from the
flowers, just a tiny bit from each blossom
that he visits, and when he has enough
he takes it home to the hive and puts it
away to eat by-and-by, in the winter,
when there are no flowers growing for
him to rifle. He does it just as men lay
away money for &#8216;a rainy day,&#8217; as we say,
and as squirrels lay up a store of nuts for
the cold weather. Now, suppose you
count those flattened, round-cornered
parts of the buttercup&mdash;how many are
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five,&#8221; said Elsie quickly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there are five of them, and they
are called petals. You will notice that
they are much narrower and slighter at
the bottom than they are at the top.
It is at the bottom that they are joined
to the central part of the flower. Now,
just where they are connected with this
central part there is a tiny sack of
honey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be <i>very</i> tiny,&#8221; said Elsie, regarding
the slender connection earnestly,
&#8220;for there isn&#8217;t room enough for much,
I&#8217;m sure. And it must be all covered up,
for I can&#8217;t see any signs of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is covered up. There is a very
small scale, or leaf, over it to protect it
from those insects who have no right to
the honey. But the bee knows how to
get at it, and he does so very quickly,
once he alights on the blossom, as we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
have just seen one do. For while he
appeared as if he were merely tumbling
clumsily around on the flower he was
sampling those honey-sacks, and we saw
how speedily he finished all five of them
on this flower and then buzzed busily
away to the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was just the same as at dinner,
then, wasn&#8217;t he mamma! But why did
he go to the other flower&mdash;didn&#8217;t he get
all he wanted from this one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, darlingest, he gets but very little
from each flower. If he could take all
he wanted from one he would never fly
right to another. And then, if all the
other insects should do the same, the
whole plan of nature would fall through
and there would soon be no life on earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsie&#8217;s eyes looked very large when
she heard this.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Would I die, and you, mamma, and
all of us&mdash;Alice and Rosie, and, oh,
everybody we know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dearie, all of us. Those few
simple plants which still, in the primitive
way, fertilize themselves, are not enough
and are too weak to carry on the vegetation
of the earth, and without the insects
and birds and the wind we never should
have been born at all; for they are
necessary to make the plants reproduce
their kinds and grow, and the plants are
necessary food for us as well as for the
animals that we eat, such as the hens and
ducks and sheep and cows. So nature
has given each flower only a little honey,
not enough for the bee, and he is compelled
to fly to many before he becomes
satisfied. And this brings us back to
the stamen and ovary again, to show
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
what they are for and how the bee
marries the two plants together after he
has collected his fee of delicious honey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am all &#8217;tention,&#8221; said Elsie, in so
quaint an imitation of older folks that
her mother was forced to smile, knowing
that she had a listener that was interested,
to say the least&mdash;a listener who felt the
importance and gravity of the study
which they were now pursuing. Elsie
never attempted big words except when
she felt dignified.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<h3>THE PAPA AND MAMMA PARTS OF THE PLANTS</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Mrs. Edson, taking hold
of the buttercup again, &#8220;you see
here, at the top of each stamen, the
slight enlargement that I mentioned. It
looks like a kind of knob, and it really
is a hard, hollow sack, or bag, containing
a fine yellow powder, which is called
pollen. Is that plain so far, dearie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pollen, yes, mamma! And do you
wish me to remember that name too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is very necessary that you
should do so. You will soon learn why.
Now look again at the green ovary.
That is also hollow, and contains seeds
or eggs, as I said before. In plants we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
call them seeds and in animals eggs.
And it is these seeds that grow into the
baby plants. But they cannot grow
alone, without help. With a certain
kind of help they can and do grow, and
what do you suppose that help is?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsie gazed earnestly at her mother,
trying to think it out. But she was
compelled to shake her head after all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing but that some of the pollen
shall be mixed with them,&#8221; said her
mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see, I see!&#8221; Elsie cried delightedly.
&#8220;That is why the stamens with
the pollen in them are right over the
ovaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, you have guessed it. The
ripe pollen, falling into the ripe ovary,
would fertilize the seeds. And with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
some plants, the earlier and simpler
kinds, this is just what happens. But
here you can see that the ovary is not
ripe. It is hard and green. When it is
ripe its color is yellow. But the pollen
is ripe now, you can see it all over the
anthers, as the knobs or sacks are called.
If the pollen should fall upon the ovary
now it would roll off without entering,
and would be wasted. Now what do
you suppose happens?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The&mdash;the&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsie hesitated, looking with very bright
eyes at her mother, almost sure enough to
go on, but not quite. It seemed so
peculiar, the thought that had come to
her, and she did not see just how it could
be.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were going to say the bee,
weren&#8217;t you?&#8221; her mother smiled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes&mdash;and would that have been
right?&#8221; Elsie cried in delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that would have been exactly
right. If we had been near enough to
examine the bee&#8217;s motions closely we
should have seen that he alighted on the
ovary, and then began to turn here and
there in order to get at the honey at
the base of each petal. As he did so he
brushed off some of the pollen, for he
was right in amongst the stamens, and
this powdery pollen stuck to his fuzzy
body and he carried it away with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he carried it away how could
it get into the flower&#8217;s ovary?&#8221; Elsie
asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It did not get into this flower&#8217;s
ovary,&#8221; her mother answered. &#8220;Nature
did not intend that it should, and that
is why the bee is introduced. For the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
other buttercup that he flew to, or some
other one that he would visit afterward,
would have its ovary ripe, and when he
alighted on it in search of honey some of
the pollen would be brushed off his body
right into this ovary that was all ready
to receive it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! But what would happen then?
The little baby buttercups would begin
to grow right away, mamma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the ovary would close up and the
seeds would begin to grow, very slowly.
They would keep on growing until they
were ripe and then they would burst
their covering and fall out on the ground.
Those of them that were fortunate
enough to become embedded in the soil,
so that they would not freeze in the
winter, would come out in the spring
as little plants, which would soon bring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
forth buttercups. That is the way with
the wild flowers. But with the cultivated
ones, like cucumbers, apples, beans,
and the like, all of those that are valuable
for eating, we are careful to save the
seeds and plant them where they will be
safe. Instead of leaving them to chance
we make a garden and plant them in it
where they will be snug and warm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And wouldn&#8217;t the seeds grow, or the
little plants come up, if the bee hadn&#8217;t
gone to the flowers, mamma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, darling, it is the bee, or some other
insect, or the birds, that marry all the
bright-colored plants in this way, as
the wind marries the soberhued ones. Without
these we should have no vegetation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, mamma, marry! Why
do you say they marry? I thought
only men and women married.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The marriage that takes place between
men and women, dear, is only a
repetition of the marriage of plants. Its
object is the same&mdash;to reproduce the
race. Plants began to marry long, long
before men and women ever came on
earth and have been doing it ever
since, fortunately for us, because if
they should give up the practice we
should have to follow suit. The earth
would go back to the barren state in
which it was before life came to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems so strange,&#8221; said Elsie.
&#8220;Why, I never heard of anything so
funny! A bee, just a little bee, and
without him&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny is scarcely the word,&#8221; Mrs.
Edson smiled, &#8220;but it is certainly wonderful.
The pumpkin, the bean, the pear,
the squash, the orange, all the fruits
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
and vegetables that we eat, and which
the animals eat, must be fertilized in
order to reproduce their kind, and all
the fertilizing is done either by the wind,
which blows the pollen from one plant
to another, or by birds and insects.
But this is only a small part of the
secret I have to tell you, just the beginning.
There are many more wonderful
things to come than I have told you yet,
but I think this is enough for the first
time. You would better think over what
you have heard until tomorrow, when
I will tell you the next step, which is
about the animals. There are four things
in this lesson that you must remember:</p>
<p>&#8220;First, every male plant has at least
one stamen, which bears pollen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Second, every female plant has one
ovary which contains seeds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Third, the seeds in the ovary must
be fertilized by the pollen in the stamens
in order to be able to grow and bear
children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fourth, flowers are fertilized by birds,
insects and the wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you can remember
all that, darling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, mamma, I&#8217;m sure I can!&#8221;
said Elsie. She thought a moment and
then added: &#8220;It was very nice of that
bumble-bee to mistake my nose for a
flower, I&#8217;m sure, for it was almost as if
he should say, &#8216;Doesn&#8217;t she look sweet&mdash;there
must be honey there!&#8217; But I
guess he didn&#8217;t think I was very sweet
when I almost scared him to death,
poor fellow!&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE FIRST LIFE ON EARTH</h3>
</div>
<p>The next day Elsie was so eager for
the hour to come when she should
learn the secret of the animals that
she had been waiting in the hammock
quite a little while when her mother
came down stairs and as soon as she
appeared in sight Elsie clapped her
hands joyously, crying out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I shall hear how the animals
get their honey, sha&#8217;n&#8217;t I, mumsey?
But, mumsey, there isn&#8217;t anything like
the petals of a buttercup on an animal,
unless it&#8217;s his ears&mdash;do animals have their
honey there&mdash;where they join the body&mdash;like
the buttercups?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Edson could not help laughing
at this funny notion.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, darling,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;animals
have no honey anywhere. In the plants
there is honey because they must have
something to attract the insects to them,
for they are rooted in the ground and
can&#8217;t move around to carry their pollen
to the other plants. And this pollen
must be carried, you remember, for that
is the way, and the only way, in which
little ones are made to be born. So
the flower has the honey in order to pay
the insect for marrying it. But animals
can move around. They can go to each
other and carry their own pollen, so
they do not need honey or anything
but themselves to attract each other.
In animals there is love instead of honey.
They love each other, in their way, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
so come together and mingle their eggs
and pollen. Only it is not called pollen
in animals, as I said before. It is called
<i>zo&ouml;sperms</i>, pronounced &#8216;zoo-o-sperms.&#8217;
That is another name that you must not
forget, for it is to the animal what
pollen is to the plant. And in order that
little animals may be born it is quite as
necessary that the zo&ouml;sperms cover or
fertilize the eggs, as, with the plants, it is
for the pollen to fertilize the seeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, mamma,&#8221; said Elsie, wonderingly,
&#8220;you said, I think, that every
plant had an ovary&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, darling, I said that every <i>female</i>
plant had an ovary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, female plant! That has
an ovary, and every male plant has a
stamen, and I think you said that they
must have, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, in order to reproduce
their kind they must have&mdash;why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, does every male animal
have a stamen and every female an
ovary?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly darling! And let me repeat
that the products of the two
must be mingled in order to bring
forth little animals. That is just what
I am going to tell you about today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you mean, mamma, that
honey in the plants grows into love in
the animals?&#8221; Elsie asked, her eyes
very wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that is a very beautiful thought
for my little girl to have!&#8221; Mrs. Edson
exclaimed, smoothing Elsie&#8217;s hair lovingly.
&#8220;And, yes, that is the truth,
put very poetically. Love is sweet,
like the honey that it replaces&mdash;at least
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
it is for us human beings. Probably
with the animals it is not of just the
same quality that it is with us, for they
do not act as if it were, but at least the
animals are an improvement on the
plants in this respect, and the love that
they feel for each other finally evolves,
in us, to become the sweet thing that
we find it to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that lovely&mdash;and so strange!&#8221;
exclaimed Elsie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, darling, it is lovely, and very
strange. There are various kinds of
love, as well as various degrees of the
same kind, but this is a subject a little
too deep for us to take up just yet.
What I wish now is to teach you how
the animals marry. And I will begin
by saying that all forms of reproduction,
which is the name given to having children,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
follow the same principle. The
animals marry in a way that is only a
variation of the plant way, and men
and women marry in a way that is a
variation of the plant and animal ways.
But let us begin right, with the first
appearance of life on earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mamma,&#8221; Elsie cried eagerly.
&#8220;But the <i>first</i> life! That must have
been very, very long ago, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was so far back in the history of
the world that we can scarcely more
than guess how long ago it must have
been. We do not even know where it
first appeared or just how it came to be.
Some scientists believe that it occurred
at the mouth of the Nile River, in Africa,
in the rich soil that the river deposits
there when it overflows its banks.
Others think it was in the sea, or along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
the shores of some ocean in a tropical
country. But we need not go into that
here. What we do know is that the
hot sun, shining on a certain spot on
the earth or sea, which was just in the
right condition, produced the first body
containing life that the globe ever had,
and that this body was only a little
speck of jelly-like substance, which we
call protoplasm, pro-to-plas-m. The
word means &#8216;first growth&#8217;, for it was
the first thing that ever appeared that
was capable of growing. We also call
it a cell. Now there was only one cell
in the world. It had no companions.
And what do you suppose happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been very lonesome,&#8221;
suggested Elsie, sympathetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it must have been&mdash;certainly
it must if it could feel or think. But,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
at all events, whether or not it did feel
lonely, it began right away to make
companions. Of course you can&#8217;t think
how it did that, can you, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I am afraid not,&#8221; Elsie hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet it was the very simplest way
imaginable. It merely divided itself into
two parts, each of which was just like
the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Elsie. &#8220;But, then,
mamma, who could tell which was the
father or mother, and which was the
child? Or were they just brother and
sister, or two brothers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was not then what we now
call &#8216;sex&#8217;, for that was only the beginning
of families, so to say, and it was very
crude, as all things are when they are
first started. But perhaps we might
call one cell the mother of the other,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
since it is always the female, and not the
male, that brings forth children, though
nobody could tell which was the mother
and which was the child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Elsie, &#8220;<i>that</i> is the strangest
thing yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems so to us, because it is so
different from our way of reproducing,
but it was the natural way, and the
same process is going on to this day.
Even little girls are born in a manner
which, though it appears very different,
is the same in principle, as we shall see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, mamma, I thought that all living
beings were obliged to have a stamen
or an ovary!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So they are obliged, dear! This cell
grew until it was too large and heavy
to be supported by its structure, or
lack of structure, and then it fell apart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
Force, or growth, was the stamen here,
and the cell itself was the ovary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then force or growth was the first
stamen, mamma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, darling, it was not, unless we
should call growth the stamen of today&mdash;which
we might do, in a way. But the
first stamen was, in form, a ray of the
sun, and the first ovary was the earth,
soil. For don&#8217;t you recall that this cell,
which was the first life-form, was produced
by the sun shining on the earth
or sea?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsie pondered on this a moment.
Then her face brightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, now I see!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;And what a beautiful set of changes,
like real poetry! The stamen in a flower,
and growth, and a ray of sunlight are
all one at bottom!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, darling, it is beautiful poetry,
when one comes thoroughly to understand
it. And when we find that love
is the source of all these different forms
and processes it becomes more beautiful
than ever. Now let us go on a little
further and you will see how that is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please hurry, mamma!&#8221; said Elsie.
&#8220;I wish to find out where I came from,
and you are going to tell me that, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, darling! That is what I
have been leading up to all this time.
Now we will speak of a number of higher
growths than the single cells are, for
there are several things yet to be made
plain before you will be able to understand
the highest growth of all, which
is that of a human being like yourself.&#8221;</p>

<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>WHERE BABY ANIMALS COME FROM</h3>
</div>
<p>At that moment there sounded a
hoarse noise near by, which was
followed by a splash, as if some body
had tumbled into the pond. Elsie looked
at her mother roguishly and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Croaky!&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Croaky was a granddaddy bullfrog
with whom they were very well
acquainted, for he sang for them every
evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad that he spoke just as he did,&#8221;
Mrs. Edson smiled, &#8220;for he reminds me
that frogs are as good an example as I
can take next. He belongs to one of
the lower classes of animals, not so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
very much higher than the plants. Now,
in the plants, you will remember, it was
necessary for the pollen to enter the
ovary in order to reach and fertilize the
seeds. But with the frog it is not so.
The female lays the eggs first, and just
as she is doing so the male places himself
in such a position towards her that he
can mingle his zo&ouml;sperms with her eggs
as they come out. That fertilizes them
and they immediately begin to grow.
First they become tadpoles, and then
little frogs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, was Old Croaky ever a little
tadpole, mumsey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, darling, he was. Every frog
was once. And before that he was an
egg, one of many, in his mother&#8217;s ovary,
and it is so with all animals. They all
of them have eggs and zo&ouml;sperms, just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
as the plants have pollen and seeds.
Only, with most of the animals, the
zo&ouml;sperms must enter the ovary in order
to fertilize the eggs, as is the way of the
plants. And it is the same with the
birds. They are higher, that is later,
in the scale of life than the frogs are.
Now the higher the creature the more
complicated becomes the process of reproduction,
even though the principle
is always the same. It is always growth,
always the life within, forcing itself
out to take form, and it is only the forms
that change. The life and force within
are the same that the first single cell
had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very wonderful, mamma,&#8221; Elsie
said, awed by the mystery, even though
she was very far from grasping the
whole of it. &#8220;And the birds, mamma,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
have they stamens, and eggs inside?
I thought their eggs were outside, in
a little nest. And some of them are,
mumsey, because, you know, I have
seen them lots of times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the eggs come out where you
can see them, in time, as the frog&#8217;s do,
but at first they are inside the mother
bird, as they are with the frogs and all
animals. Only, it is not with the birds
as it is with the frogs, for the bird&#8217;s
eggs must be fertilized by the male
zo&ouml;sperms while they are still within the
mother bird. The zo&ouml;sperms must enter
the ovary as the pollen must enter the
ovary of the plant. So the male bird,
like most male animals, has a stamen
which is a repetition of that of the flower,
made of such a shape that it can reach
the eggs in the mother bird&#8217;s ovary and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
fertilize them there. Then they come
out, they are &#8216;laid&#8217; as we say, and we see
them in the nest which the mother
and father birds have prepared for them.
And just as the seeds need to be covered
and kept warm, when they have fallen
from the ripe pods to the ground, in
order that they may live and grow into
baby plants, so the bird&#8217;s eggs must be
covered and kept warm and safe in order
that they may grow into birdies. It is
just here that you may see where the
honey of the plants begins to become
love in the higher species. For instead
of leaving the eggs to be protected or
not, according to chance, as is the way
of the plants, the mother bird covers
and warms and protects them herself.
She sits on the nest and keeps them safe
with her own body and feathers. Isn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
that lovely! And the father bird goes
to market in the woods and fields and
brings her the daintiest and best food he
can find.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he <i>nice!</i>&#8221; said Elsie appreciatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he is nice, and so is his wife,
the mother bird. Just think! A bird
is the most energetic and tireless creature
in all animated nature. It is always
on the move, urged by the force and
overflowing life within its body, and to
sit there quietly all alone on the eggs
day after day and night after night&mdash;oh,
it must be hard, so hard that we can
scarcely realize the extent of the sacrifice
she is making for her little children.
That is what love is like. And the higher
a creature is in the scale of life the more
love it has, until, in men and women,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
the acme is reached and they not only
give up their comfort for each other,
and especially for their children, but
even their lives themselves. With human
beings one can tell how high a given one
is in the scale of humanity by the
amount of love he has. Some persons
have very little, and they are nearer
the animal plane: some have a great
deal, and the more they have, the less
selfish they are, the higher they have
risen. For love is the real stamen that
fertilizes the world and makes it grow,
and the more one has of it the more
life one gives to the universe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsie felt very grave for some moments,
thinking out this deep matter. It was
too complex for her to realize wholly,
but she caught glimpses of the immortal
beauty of the ideas and she was awed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
by it. Suddenly she threw her arms
around her mother&#8217;s neck and kissed
her passionately. It had occurred to
her all at once how much her mother
loved her and how much she must have
sacrificed for her sake during all the
years of her little life, and though she
had no conception of the full extent of
the sacrifice she saw enough to make
her feel like crying for very love of that
dear and sweet mamma. Her mother
understood her and taking her in her
arms hugged her closely, sitting in silence
with her for a long time, both of them
too full of love for each other to speak.
And so the lesson for the day ended.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<h3>WHERE BABY GIRLS COME FROM</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Now, mumsey,&#8221; cried Elsie the
next day, running to her mother
at the hour set aside for their baby-talks,
&#8220;I know what comes next&mdash;it&#8217;s I,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, darling, it&#8217;s you. And it&#8217;s I,
too. Isn&#8217;t that a beautiful thought,
that you and I held the same relation
to each other that the mother bird holds
to the egg from which the birdies come!
For once you were a tiny, tiny egg inside
mamma just as it was with the
birds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh-h!&#8221; gasped Elsie, gazing at her
mother in bewilderment. She could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
realize such an astounding thing at
once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, darling,&#8221; Mrs. Edson went on,
&#8220;every female human being has an ovary,
just as every female flower has, and just
as every female bird has; and, also like
them, she has seeds or eggs in this
ovary. And she has a great many of
them. They have been growing within
her ever since she was a baby, and when
she is about twelve years old they begin
to ripen, one at a time, and pass from
the ovary into a nest that is all ready for
them inside the female body. This nest
we call the womb. At first, while she
is so young, the womb is not strong
enough to hold the egg while it grows,
so the egg soon leaves its nest to come
into the world and be lost, as so very
many seeds of the plant are. As it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
does so it acts in such a way on the young
girl that, when she first becomes aware
that something which seems strange is
happening to her, she is frightened and
does not know what to do. And as
you, darling, are now at the age when
this must come to you very soon, I am
going to prepare you for it, so that you
may know that it is natural, coming to
all girls of about your age, and that
there is nothing to be alarmed over.
All the talks that we have had were
intended as a kind of introduction to
this event and its consequences, for it
is the greatest that enters a girl&#8217;s life
before she has grown fully to be a woman.
And you were once one of these tiny eggs.
More than that, you now have within
your body, a great number of that very
kind of eggs from which you sprang.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>Elsie sat with her eyes in breathless
interest on her mother, so filled with
wonder and speculation that she could
not ask a single question. Mrs. Edson
proceeded:</p>
<p>&#8220;I must repeat dear, because it is so
very important for you to remember,
that every woman has an ovary which
contains many seeds or eggs, just as the
female flower has. These eggs, if left
unfertilized, will pass from the body
and never grow any more. But each
one, if fertilized by the papa, as the bird&#8217;s
eggs were, and as the flower seeds were,
will stay in a little nook inside the
mother&#8217;s body, where it will grow and
grow until the time comes for it to burst
forth into the world, following the same
principle that the first cell followed in
reproducing, and which all living things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
follow always. The life within forces
it away from the parent, to become a
separate growth. Then it will come
forth, and behold, the tiny seed or egg
has grown to be a baby girl or boy,
weighing several pounds!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh-h!&#8221; Elsie gasped again. &#8220;And
that is how&mdash;how&mdash;I&mdash;came to be born,
mamma!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, darlingest, it is the way in which
every living person was born. There
is not, and there cannot be, any other
way. Each child is a part both of its
father and mother. The egg in the
mother would never grow into a baby
unless it had first been fertilized by the
father, who does so through his great
love for the mamma, just as with the
birds and animals, though his love is of a
higher kind than that of the lower orders.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And does the mother-woman warm
the eggs as the bird in the nest does,
mamma, while the papa-man brings her
nice things to eat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dearie, only the mother-woman
has the nest inside her body, as I have
said, and she keeps the little one safe
and warm there much longer than the
bird sits on her nest. And think of all
the years after the baby is born that she
waits on and cares for it! There is no
other love that equals in devotion that
of the mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsie, without a word, her eyes swimming
in tears, kissed her mother affectionately.
She had realized a little more
of what she owed to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Mrs. Edson, &#8220;I must tell
you how to care for this nest in which,
by and by, when you have grown up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
and have a husband and are strong
enough, you will be keeping a little
baby of your own. Because many girls
who become married do not know these
things there is a dreadful amount of
sickness and misery in the world, all
needless. And it does seem too bad&mdash;when
merely a few words at the right
time would have saved it all!&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course Elsie was not old enough to
understand how this could be, so she
said nothing, but sat looking earnestly
at her mother as she went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, dear, you must
know that the little baby&#8217;s nest, which
we call the womb, is placed in the lower
portion of the woman&#8217;s body, just above
the &#8216;private parts&#8217;. Perhaps it is put
there because it is the safest place for it
in the whole body&mdash;for the eggs and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
womb are very delicate, and must not
be exposed to any danger of injury.
So it grows in the interior of the trunk,
where outside dangers would be less
likely to reach and spoil it, so that the
woman would be sick all her life and
never have any children. Many hopeless
female complaints, ending with premature
and painful death, are caused
by lack of proper care of the womb
and its entrance. That care consists
chiefly in preventing the womb from
being touched by anything, and keeping
the entrance clean. It is very simple&mdash;just
keep the entrance clean and the
womb untouched by anything. An observance
of such slight rules as these
would have saved many and many a
poor soul from a life of continual misery
and suffering.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have told you, dear, long ago how
to keep the entrance clean. And now
that you will soon begin to menstruate,
as the passing out of the eggs is called,
I shall have but little to add to what you
already know, but I will repeat it from
the beginning in order that you may
have it all clear in your mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, bathe the entrance every time
you bathe the rest of your body, and at
such other times as you may feel the
need of doing so. Never neglect this.
It may have evil consequences. Just
keep it clean, and never touch it for any
other purpose. And be careful to use
only your own towels, for disease is
easily communicated to these parts by
cloths that are not clean, and you never
can be too careful in this respect. It is
plain enough, and easy enough to do,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
isn&#8217;t it darling&mdash;and you will always
remember about it, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, mamma, that is easy
enough!&#8221; Elsie said quickly. &#8220;I could remember
a lot more than that, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have been so infinitely
much better for so many poor sick
creatures if they had known and remembered
even that!&#8221; Mrs. Edson sighed,
holding her little daughter closely, as
if she would protect her from not only
that harm but all others. &#8220;But,&#8221; she
continued, &#8220;I must now tell you what you
may be expecting to come to you before
long, when it will be harder to keep the
entrance clean than it has been so far,
and when to keep it clean will be more
necessary than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every twenty-eight days, dearie, beginning
with you very soon now, there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
will be a flow of blood into the little
baby&#8217;s nest, the womb, and this will
come out of your body through this
entrance to the womb. As soon as you
see any signs of it on your body or
clothing you must come right and tell
me, as you would if you had cut your
finger or stubbed your toe on a stone. It
is something to be very proud of for it
shows the possibility of motherhood,
and it must be given the very best care,
which is, as I have said, chiefly to keep
the parts clean. By and by when you
are grown old enough and strong enough,
and have a husband, who will fertilize
the eggs, one of them will grow into a
little baby, but it will be a long time
yet before that can be, and until then you
will have this flow every twenty-eight
days, for the sake of your health. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
brings more work for the womb to do,
while the menses, as they are called,
continue, and therefore you may feel
out of sorts both mentally and bodily
for two or three days. But this will
pass away when the flow ceases, and if
proper care is taken of the womb and
passages you will never feel anything
worse than this. Some women feel great
pain at this time, but almost always the
reason is that some of their internal parts
have been injured in one way or another.
Sometimes lack of proper food, sufficient
fresh air and sun, or not enough exercise
and clean water are responsible for a
portion of the pain. In order to have
strong reproductive organs a woman
should be healthy in all bodily ways,
and anything that she can do to improve
her general health will be favorable to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
her at the time of the menses as well as
at all times. Do you think you understand
all this, darling, and can remember
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, mamma,&#8221; said Elsie
hesitatingly. &#8220;There is a lot to it, but
I&#8217;ll try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my dear little girl! To try
is the next thing to doing. Only remember
that when you don&#8217;t know what to
do, and have tried, come to mamma.
That is one great reason why mammas
are&mdash;to help little girls who have
tried.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsie kissed her mother warmly, and
then sat looking dreamily out towards
the woods. She had learned many
strange things and was thinking them
over. Suddenly she spoke, as if unconsciously,
saying:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
&#8220;Who would ever have thought that
so much could come out of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of what?&#8221; her mother asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, out of a bee trying to step on
my nose!&#8221; said Elsie.</p>
